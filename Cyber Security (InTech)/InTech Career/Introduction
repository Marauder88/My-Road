-- VALUE MINDSET
deviate from distractions and get the work done
make it an habit to be uncofrtable thats where power is

mindset for success is KEY, growth mindset implies having character and
backbone in the face of adversity, you fail but stand back up and try until you make it

people with limited beliefs either because they lack character or their life was too easy for them
for wethever reason tend to have a limited set of beliefs that ultimalely become their seatback

the human brain has incredible potential, is a maullable, has neuroplasticity which allows new connections
and existant ones to get stronger and increase their signaling, this allows individuals to be capable of learning and masterinf ANYTHING if they put time and efforst, and have the belief

some brains are wired to be lazy but that is part of the mindset, humans can rewire their brains completly into being disciplined and ferioucious antrepenours, atheltes, soldiers, etc
the brain is very powerful so use it as your tool, dont treat it like your enemy, learn to use it and master it

Moving forward after having the right mindset you must focus on your goals and what you plan to achieve, there are different types of goals such as:
outcome goal - I want to be the best in the world at x
deadline / delivery goal - I want to deliver this or create x in the world that will cause x impact
peroccess goal - I want to train this much or learn x new skill / skills
performance goal - I want to do better at x

Best Year ever by michael hyat 2019, speaks about goals as being something that should challenge us forcing us to leave our confort zome
the four main mindset qualities we need to achieve a serious goal are
1. learning to adapt and grind outside your confort zone 
2. face your fears anything great is beyond your fear, fear filters out the worthy from the unworthy
3. if failures and pain comes to you embrace them, learn from them, they are meant to be your teachers, not your executioners, the ones who endure and work without breaking come out stronger than ever
4. dont overthink or stay paralyzed without action, the ones who stay static starve, the ones who hunt and move survive, movement is life and that applies to goals, move and work thowards them, inactivty gets you nowhere
